    <h1>A Short Summary About Me</h1>
    <p>Assalamualaikum, I'm Nik Muhamad Muaz Ibrani Bin Jailani. I'm 21 years old. I'm from Kuala Krai, Kelantan. Currently a full-time student and in my last semester of Diploma in UiTM Machang. I believe myself to be the artist of my life, and I see life as an art form. Whatever life throws at me, I fight to keep it as bright and optimistic as I can. I am a passionate and curious individual. Interested in learning more about life and its future possibilities. No matter what is happening, I want to keep a smile on my face because it gives me confidence. Also, I grew raised in a diverse neighbourhood. I am an extrovert, so I love talking with others while discovering their cultures and traditions. This makes me full of joy.</p>
    <p>I am also loyal nonetheless very frustrated. If I'm not understood well, I become furious. Although I get very upset within, my actions don't match that. However, I want to work on this characteristic flaw a little because my close friends and family often are unaware that I face some difficulties. So, when I need support, they lack it. I'm attempting to think of the world as it is and show its true shades, whether or not that's beneficial or harmful. I think that since existence is a gift, it should to be dealt with with affection, tenderness, and reverence.</p>

    <p><img src="image/coffee.jpg" width="250px" height="335px"></p>

    <p>People often wonder why I have such a fixation on coffeeâ€”its in nearly all of my photos, I talk about it all the time, I plan my vacations around lattes, and of course, I drink it everyday. Coffee is my first love. At a young age, I fell in love with coffee in a ceramic mug filled with black gold, filled with old books about socialism and modern art. The warm, inviting atmosphere evoked excitement as I watched Saturday morning cartoons. Dad and I left for high school at six in the morning while he read the newspaper and sipped coffee. Instead of going to the soccer fields, students met together after school at the cafe. When I made my own coffee for the first time in college, coffee was there for me. I eagerly waited while my freshly ground coffee brewed to the point of perfection. Classes in the morning broke up and went to coffee cafes for afternoon study sessions that lasted till late at night.</p>
    <p>Coffee cafe chairs create a cozy atmosphere, where love and friendships are built over steamed milk. The best seat is always in the corner, and the aroma and ambiance of cafes are perfect for gossiping and confessing secrets. Life's unpredictable world offers an elixir of coffee waiting for us, providing unconditional support and a calming beverage. Despite the side effects, coffee remains the elixir, guiding us through breakups, breakthroughs, and happiest moments. We continue to fall in love, eagerly anticipating our future together.</p>
