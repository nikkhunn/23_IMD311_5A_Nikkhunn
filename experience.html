     <p>I used to sell "Apam Balik" 2020 in my hometown for six months. It is quite challenging since it requires patience and endurance. When you need to work in the kitchen. It can be quite hot. Since selling "Apam Balik" in a stall. It can be much more challenging when the weather is sunny. It is also the Covid Season, when the virus was just discovered and it can be quite dangerous since that year, we don't have any vaccine to make us immune from it. The virus is deadly to us humans and also the animals. My and colleagues have to wear masks and hand gloves since we serve food to the customer. We need to take some precautions.</p> 
    <p>Then after six months, I quit the job and quarantine in my home since the virus thing spread so fast and can be deadly. It is so hard since we have to stay home. Then when the covid thing slow down a bit and we were allowed to go out even though the virus thing still spreading and the government gave us vaccines to prevent the attacks of the Covid virus. After a while, I work at another job. Selling drinks by the mall. The weather is always sunny and sometimes rainy. It can be quite challenging. but in the end, it is worth it and I can experience the life of adulting and how hard it is to survive in this cruel world as a teenager. But in the end. It is worth it and I am kind of glad for the experience.</p>
